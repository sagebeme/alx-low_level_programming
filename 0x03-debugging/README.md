0x03. Debugging
===============

This project practices **debugging** C programs: finding and fixing bugs in given code (e.g. logic errors in date conversion or largest-number logic). You do not write programs from scratch; you fix the provided code.

Tasks
-----

**Task numbers:** 0, 1, 2, 3

### 0. Fix main (infinite loop)

mandatory

Fix the bug in the given `0-main.c` so the program does not run an infinite loop. Compile and run to verify.

**Repo:**

-   GitHub repository: `alx-low_level_programming`
-   Directory: `0x03-debugging`
-   File: `0-main.c`

### 1. Fix main (positive/negative)

mandatory

Fix the bug in `1-main.c` so that it correctly prints whether a number is positive or negative. Compile and run to verify.

**Repo:**

-   GitHub repository: `alx-low_level_programming`
-   Directory: `0x03-debugging`
-   File: `1-main.c`

### 2. Largest number

mandatory

Fix the bug in `2-largest_number.c` so it correctly returns the largest of three numbers. Compile and run to verify.

**Repo:**

-   GitHub repository: `alx-low_level_programming`
-   Directory: `0x03-debugging`
-   File: `2-largest_number.c`

### 3. Print remaining days

mandatory

Fix the bug in the date conversion logic (`3-convert_day.c`, `3-print_remaining_days.c`, and related mains) so it correctly prints how many days are left in the year. Compile and run to verify.

**Repo:**

-   GitHub repository: `alx-low_level_programming`
-   Directory: `0x03-debugging`
-   File: `3-convert_day.c`, `3-print_remaining_days.c`, `3-main_a.c`, `3-main_b.c`

**How to run / test**

1. Read the task description to understand the expected behavior.
2. Find the bug, fix it, then compile and run to verify.
