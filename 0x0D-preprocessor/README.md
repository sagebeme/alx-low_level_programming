0x0D. Preprocessor
==================

This project practices the **C preprocessor**: `#include`, `#define`, macros with arguments, and conditional compilation (`#ifdef`, `#ifndef`, `#endif`). You write header guards and macros instead of some functions.

Tasks
-----

**Task numbers:** 2, 4, 5, 6, 101

### 2. main (preprocessor)

mandatory

Create a program that prints the name of the source file it was compiled from, using the preprocessor. Use the __FILE__ macro or similar.

**Repo:**

-   GitHub repository: `alx-low_level_programming`
-   Directory: `0x0D-preprocessor`
-   File: `2-main.c`

### 4. puts (macro)

mandatory

Write a macro or use the preprocessor so that a program prints a message (e.g. using a macro that expands to puts). Complete the source as required by the project.

**Repo:**

-   GitHub repository: `alx-low_level_programming`
-   Directory: `0x0D-preprocessor`
-   File: (header/source as per project)

### 5. printf (macro)

mandatory

Write a macro that expands to printf with a fixed format string. Complete the source as required by the project.

**Repo:**

-   GitHub repository: `alx-low_level_programming`
-   Directory: `0x0D-preprocessor`
-   File: (header/source as per project)

### 6. size (macro)

mandatory

Write a macro that prints the size of various types (char, int, long int, long long int, float). Use sizeof and the preprocessor.

**Repo:**

-   GitHub repository: `alx-low_level_programming`
-   Directory: `0x0D-preprocessor`
-   File: (header/source as per project)

### 101. quote

mandatory

Write a program that prints a quote to standard error using a macro or preprocessor. Complete as required by the project.

**Repo:**

-   GitHub repository: `alx-low_level_programming`
-   Directory: `0x0D-preprocessor`
-   File: (source as per project)

**How to run / test**

1. Ensure headers have include guards and correct macro definitions.
2. Compile and run any provided main to verify macro expansion.
