Pointers and strings
0 - c function that concatenates two strings.
1 - function that concatenates two strings.
	Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
	The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
	it will use at most n bytes from src; and
	src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
	Return a pointer to the resulting string dest
