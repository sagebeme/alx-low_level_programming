Pointers and strings
0 - C function that concatenates two strings.
1 - C function that concatenates two strings.
	Prototype: char *_strncat(char *dest, char *src, int n);
	The _strncat function is similar to the _strcat function, except that
	it will use at most n bytes from src; and
	src does not need to be null-terminated if it contains n or more bytes
	Return a pointer to the resulting string dest
2 - C function that copies a string
3 - C function that compares two strings
4 - C function that reverses the content of an array of integers
5 - C function that changes all lowercase letters of a string to uppercase
6 - C function that capitalizes all words of a string
7 - C  function that encodes a string into 1337.
	Letters a and A should be replaced by 4
	Letters e and E should be replaced by 3
	Letters o and O should be replaced by 0
	Letters t and T should be replaced by 7
	Letters l and L should be replaced by 1
	Prototype: char *leet(char *);
